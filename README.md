#Potholer

Potholer detects and displays potholes near you. It runs in the background while you do other things.

Some things of note:

I've only tested this on a Sony Xperia S

I never put in catches to deal with no internet connectivity. It will probably crash if you open while it is not connected

Try starting at a Severity of 7, then going up or down from there

I have yet to put in a clause for the same pothole being hit multiple times. If 1000 people hit the same hole, it'll show up as 1000 holes on the map

It probably won't work. Why? Because I haven't put in my Google Maps key, and because it doesn't know where to go for the .php files (I have yet to upload them and update the location)
